Reflection:

Initial Write up:
This will accompany the first commit, and just provide a small explanation. I have to apologise, the first commit is indeed on a Sunday even though it was mentioned that A lot of people were only commiting sunday night and it is currently stressful for me to try and get this done which was emphasised. Unfortunately I was unable to do any assignment work over the Friday, Saturday and Sunday mornings due to some circumstances, some medical I won't elaborate on here. That being said, I hope my submission, in what state it is in by 10pm will sufficiently show I understand react and its logic as much as I believe I do.
